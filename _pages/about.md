About Me
======
Xiaotong Zhao is currently a Research Associate in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Prof. [Anthony Man-Cho So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/). Before joining CUHK, I received Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology from Tongji University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Qingjiang Shi](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/info/1092/3129.htm). I received my M.Sc. degree, under the supervision of Prof. [Enbin Song](https://enbinsong.weebly.com/) in the School of Mathematics, Sichuan University from Sichuan University in 2020. My main research interests are nonlinear optimization and its applications to signal processing and wireless communications.
